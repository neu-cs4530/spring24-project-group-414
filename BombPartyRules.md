[Bomb Party](https://jklm.fun/) is a multiplayer party game developed by [Sparklin Labs](https://sparklinlabs.com/). The rules for our modified version of Bomb Party are as follows. 
## Players and turns

- Once a player enters a valid word or the bomb blows up, their turn ends.
## Bomb

- If a player enters a valid word, the bomb's timer is increased by 5 seconds
- If the bomb blows up, the timer will be reset to the original duration.
- When the bomb blows up, the player who's turn it is currently will lose a life.
